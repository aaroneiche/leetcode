# [Richest Customer Wealth](https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/submissions/)

### Time: ~ 15 minutes


### Thoughts:
My first solution had an abysmal relative time - faster than 5%. My second was faster than 93%. The difference was mostly the use of a `for` loop instead of an `array.each`. The latter is significantly slower, apparently.
